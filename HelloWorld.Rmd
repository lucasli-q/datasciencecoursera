## This is a Markdown File

### I'll use this as a test for Markdown Projects

**This is in bold** while *this is in italics*

~~It's also easy to strikethrough texts~~ and make superscripts, as in m^2^

I can also create links, for instance the link to [my github page](https://github.com/lucasli-q)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print("I can also write texts using the command print")
```

```{r}
print("but the command itself will only show if I don't use echo=FALSE")
```

> "If I'm trying to quote someone, I can do that as well" - Me

Lists are also possible if:

* You enroll in a Data Science Course
  + Especially if it is the one available on Coursera
* You read the R Markdown Cheat Sheet

What about a simple table?

Name | Age | Profession
-----|-----|------------
Lucas| 25  | Chemist
Jo√£o | 24  | Artist

An equation is also possible: $n=p.V/R.T$
