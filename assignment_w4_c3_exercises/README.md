# Tidying and summarizing accelerometer data

This project is a task from the "Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project". In this task, a .zip file was available, which contained several .txt files with data of several subjects performing six different activities. This data was collected from accelerometers and gyroscopes.

The code was written to provide ways for this data to be merged together, cleaned and analyzed by calculating the mean for each subject/activity. The final result is the table, in .txt file, that contains the means for each activity as performed by each subject.

The code should run smoothly as it does not depend on specific working directories and/or scoping.
